What to do:
Download the Bouncing Balls code, save it to a file named bounce_house.py and get it to work
When you are testing, make sure you click the screen...and click it again, etc.
Modify the code in these ways
    Create a separate file named Ball.py
    Remove the Ball class from bounce_house.py and put it into Ball.py and then import Ball into bouncey_house.py
    Test the code and make sure it still works -- fix it

    Add a new variable to __init__ named square  -- the initial value should be "False"
    Test again
    Now, add code to make_ball
    This code should randomly assign True or False to ball.square
    Test

Modify the code in on_draw:
    If ball.square is True, it should draw a square instead of a circle
    Otherwise, it draws a circle (the code that is already there.
    Test
    Do something else of your own invention.
    Test
