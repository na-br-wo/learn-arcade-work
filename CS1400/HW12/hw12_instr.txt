Begin Homework 12 by downloading the code from the Turn and Move
sample. 
Save the sample code to a file and name it tank_jr.py. 
Make the following changes/updates:
1. Read ALL of the comments carefully
2. !done Change the sprite to another vehicle from the arcade resources
3. !done Change it so a left mouse click does the same thing as a right mouse click
4. In addition to mouse clicks, add keypad movement  (don't worry about rotation for this part)
   1. You will need a new property in the Player constructor to tell you whether or not you are in mouse movement
   2. Up arrow moves the sprite up
   3. Down arrow moves down
   4. Left arrow moves left
   5. Right arrow moves right
HINTS: if you don't know how,
1. Go back to the reading assignment for examples of how to move the sprite object
2. Create small "temp" files to just work on the problem at hand
3. Solve one problem at a time. If you want to brainstorm, do it in comments, not code
4. In the myPlayer class, sometimes you are referencing self and sometimes you are referencing self.player_sprite -- seeing that and keeping it straight will help
