1.    For the knock_knock assignment, I had several nested if statements and else statements if any of the “if” statements were false. As I was writing if statements I would include a command: print(‘works’) so that I would get the output ‘works’ if all the if statements up to that point were operating correctly.
    For the guess assignment, I tested it by choosing random numbers between 1 and 3 to see if the success and failure messages were working correctly. 

2.   I had several frustrating errors due to not having the correct number of spaces in some of my if/else statements. I also went down a rabbit hole and learned
To use the .upper() to make sure the input command is not case-sensitive. That took a bit of time but it is in our book and was satisfying to implement.  

I also struggled with concatination; chaning the user max_value input into a string for the next input prompt. Needed to assign max_value to a new variable that was a string and used that for my user_choice input.

3.    For the knock-knock joke, I’m not sure if doing it all with if/else statements is the cleanest way. Maybe storing things as variables if the if statements
Turn out to be true. It is hard to describe things in the docstrings without feeling like my description is confusing.
