Requirements:
Download the code from Drawing Shapes with Classes (Links to an external site.) and paste it into a file named shapes.py
Make sure you can get it to work and you understand what it is doing
Change the value of NUMBER_OF_SHAPES to something you like better than the current value
Now, create a new sub-class named Fish
This will be a sub-class of the Shape class
All fish may have the same size
draw() -- it will have its own draw() method to draw the fish
This will be a very simple fish
the body -- an ellipse,  plus
the tail -- a triangle, plus
a little circle eye (black)
the body and tail will be the color of a goldfish (orange, of course)
You need to be able to draw the fish facing left or right, based on the delta_x property
if delta_x is -1, the fish should face towards the left side
if delta_x is 1, the fish should face right
move()
The fish class will have its own move method
Fish will only move left and right
a left-facing fish will move left
a right-facing fish will move right
When it gets to the edge of the screen,
The fish reverses the direction it faces
MyGame.setup()
modify the MyGame.setup() method to create 5 separate fish to add to the shape list that are appended to the list of shapes
to reiterate, all of your fish can be the same size and color
but the following  things should be randomized
left or right-facing
x and y coordinates
Work out the bugs
Submit
shapes.py
supporting files if needed
